Experimental project by me, started when I had no job. Kivi tries to be nice Key/Value store. I'm not trying to create yet another competitive K/V store, I've started this project just for fun and mainly to learn event driven programing paradigm and principals of async I/O (epoll, kqueue, select, ...).

Kivi is inspired by Redis (http://github.com/antirez/redis) and if you look at code you'll find many similarities.

Now only supported commands are:

	kivi> GET <key>
	kivi> SET <key> <value>
	kivi> DEL <key>


Compile
-------
	server: gcc kivi.c -o kivi
	client: gcc client.c -o client


Run
---
	server: ./kivi
	client: ./client <ip/host> <port>
